# Cryptocurrency is all the rage. You have decided to create your own,
# KelloggCoin, that will massively disrupt financial markets at the Global
# Hub.

# Don't change the following code, which represents a series of transactions, each
# of which represents a transfer of KelloggCoin from one user to another â€“ transactions 
# with no from_user are from the "ICO" (Initial Coin Offering)

blockchain = [
  { "from_user" => nil, "to_user" => "ben", "amount" => 20000 },
  { "from_user" => nil, "to_user" => "brian", "amount" => 20000 },
  { "from_user" => "ben", "to_user" => "evan", "amount" => 9000 },
  { "from_user" => "brian", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 7000 },
  { "from_user" => "evan", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 400 },
  { "from_user" => "ben", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 1500 },
  { "from_user" => "anthony", "to_user" => "ben", "amount" => 4500 },
  { "from_user" => "anthony", "to_user" => "evan", "amount" => 1750 }
]


# Write code below that returns the number of KelloggCoin that each user has in their 
# KelloggCoin "wallet".


# Initialize an empty hash to store user balances
balances = Hash.new(0)

# Process each transaction in the blockchain
blockchain.each do |transaction|
  from_user = transaction["from_user"]
  to_user = transaction["to_user"]
  amount = transaction["amount"]

  # Deduct from sender's balance if not an ICO transaction
  balances[from_user] -= amount if from_user
  
  # Add to receiver's balance
  balances[to_user] += amount
end

# Output balances
balances.each do |user, balance|
  puts "#{user.capitalize}'s KelloggCoin balance is #{balance}" if user
end

# It should print out:
# Ben's KelloggCoin balance is 14000
# Brian's KelloggCoin balance is 13000
# Evan's KelloggCoin balance is 10350
# Anthony's KelloggCoin balance is 2650
